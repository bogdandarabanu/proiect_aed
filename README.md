In this project, we used data analysis to examine the characteristics of white wine and red wine, such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acidity, residual sugar, chloride, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH , sulfates, alcohol and quality. The aim of this project is to understand the relationship between these characteristics and wine quality, as well as to identify possible differences between white wine and red wine.
To achieve this goal, we used various data analysis techniques, such as statistical description, exploratory data analysis, and modeling.
